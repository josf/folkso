First steps. Installed ADOdb. Very easy to install and set up
connection. Will work for a generic install with provider. Cursory
look at benchmarks looks promising. Slightly slower than native
php+mysql.

Things are slowly working. Stored procedures seems to be a good
idea. Had a horrible time getting my parameter sorting function (part
of normalization routine) to work but now it does.

Right now I'm working with ADOdb. Seems pretty good. Offers cached
selects (stores them in temp files somewhere). Trying to figure out
how to use stored procedures with ADOdb. I can call them all right,
but I'm not sure about recovering result sets. Should be possible
though.

ADOdb does not seem to provide anything for dealing with result sets
returned by  stored procedures. I am waiting for an answer on their
forum, but MySQL does not seem to be a priority with them and no one
has answered.

Right now I am looking at MDB2, which is part of PEAR and supersedes
the traditional DB. MDB2 has stored procedures for its mysql driver,
so I am assuming that this will work for me, but I am going to test
first.

Still messing around with MDB2. Why is it that no one seems to be
doing the same thing that I am?

Installed a simple "indexer.php" on Fabula. It works and is churring
away. Need to add feature that will not count visits from robots.

We have decided to have a dual-install php4 php5. I am setting it up
now. So far:

  # apt-get install php5-cgi

Might need to do '# a2enmod suexec' but am not sure yet. Going to test
first without that.
